Getting and Cleaning Data
Final Project
Peter Johnson

This scipt requires no input, just run it and it will produce the desired cleaned data.  

First it downloads and unzips the file, and then reads all of the individual datasets into R.
It first merges all of the training data and testing data into seperate objects before then combiining them.

Next it uses the features file to name the columns in the merged dataset.

The script then uses grep to find measurements that only include the mean or std.  It then uses this to make a 
subset of the data.  This subset is then labeled in the same fashion.  

The names then are cleaned and made more descriptive.  All symbols are removed and abbreviations are expanded for clarity.

The subset is then copied into an independent tidy data set tidyData which is then written to a .txt file.
